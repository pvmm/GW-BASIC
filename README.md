# Port of Microsoft GW-BASIC to Z80

This repo contains an ongoing port of Microsoft's GW-BASIC interpreter from 8086 to Z80.  This
is being accomplished by writing a porting tool, named 'conv.py', which is able to convert the
source files in the Microsoft Macro Assembler format to Z80.  This tool isn't a general purpose
ISA conversion tool, but something tailor made for this particular code base.

## Status

A lot of the ASM files in this repo can be translated to Z80, but the generated code isn't
perfect yet; a lot of instructions being generated are invalid and the code generator has to
be reviewed.  Having said that, the generator is able to start and finish going through these
files:

  * ADVGRP.ASM
  * BIPRTU.ASM
  * BIPTRG.ASM
  * BISTRS.ASM
  * DSKCOM.ASM
  * FIVEO.ASM
  * GENGRP.ASM
  * GIOCAS.ASM
  * GIOCON.ASM
  * GIOTBL.ASM
  * GWEVAL.ASM
  * GWLIST.ASM
  * GWMAIN.ASM
  * MACLNG.ASM
  * OEM.H
  * IBMRES.ASM
